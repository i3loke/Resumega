Version Control:\\\\n   - Since you're using this for information storage, consider using Git for version control of your MDX files.\\\\n\\\\n6. Automated Updates:\\\\n   - You could set up a GitHub Action or similar to automatically deploy changes when you update your MDX files.\\\\n\\\\n7. Customization:\\\\n   - Modify the blog template to better suit your needs as a database interface.\\\\n   - Add custom fields or metadata to your MDX files to enhance organization and searchability.\\\\n\\\\nFor maintaining the original document formatting:\\\\n\\\\n1. Use HTML tags within your MDX for precise control:\\\\n   ```mdx\\\\n   \u003cdiv style=\\\\\\\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;\\\\\\\"\u003e\\\\n     Your content here...\\\\n   \u003c/div\u003e\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n2.
